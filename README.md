This repository contains a Streamlit application that demonstrates how to create a cross-account IAM role in AWS between an owner AWS account and a requestor account. This app is designed to:

1. Fetch AWS resource ARNs

2. Fetch IAM permissions associated with the selected resource

3. Create IAM resources in the owner account

4. Create IAM resources in the requestor account

**Getting Started**

2. The app is developed in Python 3.9, it is compatible with 3.10 and 3.11 versions as well.Make sure you have at least Python 3.9 version installed.
3. Streamlit: If you donâ€™t have it, install using pip install streamlit.
4. Requests Library:  Install using "pip install requests", requests libary is used to handle  HTTP calls within the application.

`git clone https://github.com/rajikrishnamoorthy/crossaccountiamtool.git`

`cd crossaccountiamtool`

2.**Install the dependencies**

   `pip install requests`

3.**Add your Lambda function URLs**

   Update your Lambda function URLs in app.py (or wherever the main code is located) with your own.

4.**Run the Streamlit app**

`streamlit run app.py`
